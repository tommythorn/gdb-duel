DUEL -  A high level language for debugging C programs.

  Duel is a special purpose language designed for concise state
  exploration of debugged C programs under existing debuggers.
  It allows you to explore your program's state better than either
  the debugger's commands, a C interpreter, or print statements
  added to your programs. The debugger is extended with the new
  'dl' command for Duel expressions, e.g.,

     gdb> dl x[0..10].level >? 5
     x[3].level = 14
     x[8].level = 6

  prints the "level" fields of array elements x[0] to x[10] that are greater
  than 5.  The output includes the values 14 and 6, as well as their
  symbolic representation "x[3].level" and "x[8].level". Linked list and
  other complex data structures are just as easy. Most of C (e.g. for, if)
  is also supported, e.g., int i; for(i=0; i<11; i++) if(x[i].level>5) x[i].

Even if you don't normally use debuggers, but you are programming in C, give
Duel a try! The man page & help even include a summary of useful gdb commands.
The man page (duel.1) contains an introduction & many examples.

Duel is debugger-independent, but the current distribution interface only
with gdb. You will need the source for gdb-4.6, 4.7 or 4.8. Duel is public
domain code. Do whatever you like with it - add it to commercial debuggers,
to dbx/sdb or even make it part of the GNU project.

NO PART OF THIS DISTRIBUTION CONTAINS ANY COPYRIGHT OR DERIVED CODE,
(i.e. no GPL code, either). Free and public domain code need no disclaimer,
which is obvious to anyone in the software business.

Duel is available for anonymous ftp from ftp.cs.princeton.edu, in
/duel/duel.tar.Z. "tar.Z" format means you should use the command
 "zcat duel.tar.Z | tar xf -" to unpack the files.

The Usenix Jan/93 paper about Duel is also available as tech report 399,
in /reports/1992/399.ps.Z on ftp.cs.princeton.edu, or, in it Usenix
formatting, as /duel/usenix.paper.ps.Z. The software & man page are more
up-to-date though.

See MANIFEST for a list of files in the distribution. The file INSTALL
explains how to install duel. MANUAL is a formatted version of the manual
duel.1.

If you are using duel and find it useful, or have any comments or suggestion,
please drop me a line! duel.out is automatically produced to contain
the dl commands you have used, I would appreciate it if you email it to
me so that I could collect usage information. Thanks!
