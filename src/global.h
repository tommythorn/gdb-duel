/*************
 Parsing: the expression is converted into a tree.
 Each node of this tree is of 'tnode' type.
 Nodes can be:
 An operator (like '+', or ':=' or 'for')
 A  constant (numbers. Strings are pointers to space!)
 A  symbol.
 A  regular expression (really a symbol extention)

 The evaluation of any node results in:
 1. 'Environment': duel variables and their values
 2. symbolic expression which describe the computation
    meaning: keep the parentethis. in the expression a<<(3+b) (even if not needed!)
 3. A type & value

 Values:
 Values are always a fixed length area of bytes; Any C type is like that.

/****** TYPES *******
  A type is described in the typical compiler's way, which is also gdb's
  way. That is, a type is made of 'atomic' types, like 'pointer to',
  'array of', etc. Each atomic type is described by a 'ctype' node. Ctype
  node points to other ctype nodes as required. For example, a ctype node
  of 'array of' will point to the node 'int' for the 'C' type array of int.
  [The name ctype is used to indicate the C language type; 'type' is too
   generic a term]
  Example:
   char *(*f[])() ;
  Here, f is an array of pointers to functions returning a pointer to char.
  The type is described with the top node being of CTK_ARRAY type. It
  points to a 'CTK_PTR' node, which points to a 'CTK_FUNC' node which
  points to a 'CTK_PTR' node which points to a 'CTK_CHAR' node which has,
  as size, 1.

  The size of a type is the number of bytes occupied by it. it is zero
  for types like 'function'. An array of 10 integers will have as size
  10*sizeof(int)

  A note on UCHAR vs CHAR vs SCHAR:
  Internally, duel supports all three forums (for aritmetic).
  For output, only "char" types are considered ASCII, and will be displayed
  as 'A' instead of "65", etc. The same is true for char[] and char*.
  GDB doesn't really support "signed char", but some compilers do;
  we convert "signed char" into just a "char" when the default char is signed.
  This is only significant for output.
  Maybe duel shouldn't support "char" at all, and force everything to be
  "schar" or "uchar". I'm not sure. I prefer "char" asa distnct  type
  which implies "string" and uchar/schar as "integral".

/***** VALUES
   used to keep information when evaluating an expression. A value is
   either:
   1) a right-value, which is represented in a fixed number of bytes that
      actually contain its value. Example: result of '+' operation.
   2) a left-value. This is a reference to the actual value, which
      resides in the debuggee's address space.
   3) a special-value. This contains a long value specifying a special
      target location (e.g. register) from which values can be fetched
      or written to. However, special-values can not be manipulated (i.e
      have an offset added to them, as done to an lvalue struct).

   Note that the operation '*x' starts with x as an lvalue - a pointer to
   x is kept. Then, '*x' is executed, fetching the value of x and creating
   another lvalue, which points to where x has pointed to! This allows
   &*x to be executed, as well as *x=1 or &x[1] ...
   When the value of an lvalue is actually needed, it must be fetched
   from the debugge's space.

/**** OP CODES ****
 Opcodes are divided into groups, or 'kinds'. For example, all the
 C regular unary operators, binary operators, etc.
 An opcode is defined by its 'kind' and actual value. The value is,
 in most cases, a single char. For example, the C plus operator is
 defined as op_kind=OPK_BIN and op='+'. The C operator '+=' is
 defined as op_kind=OPK_ASSIGN and op='+'.
 some operators are uniquely identified by type alone (e.g. func call).
 In the lexer there is a table of actual operators as tokens, and
 the kind & value assigned to each.
 Several opertors use more than one char, and are defined below.
 the OPK_SBIN, etc kinds are special in the sense that A op B isn't
 computed in the normal way of the C language (i.e. compute both sides,
 then apply the operator). Such operators include ',' '&&', etc.
