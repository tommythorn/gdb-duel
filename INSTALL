INSTALLING DUEL 1.10 distribution   mg@cs.princeton.edu (M. Golan) Mar 93
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

All files in the distribution are public domain (not gnuish!) code.


BASICS
Duel is a library, normally linked with a debugger. Currently only gdb
is supported. However, the code in the distribution contains a self-link
module which can be used to test duel expressions w/o gdb (useful only
to verify duel, or if you plan to port or use as a portable debugging tool).

Normally, Duel runs on top of the GNU debugger gdb(1). In order to use it,
you must first install gdb. Duel should work with gdb version 4.6 and
later. For older versions, some minor changes might be needed to
the interface module duelgdb.c. Before duel is installed, unpack
and compile the regular gdb distribution. The Duel distribution
files should be unpacked in subdirectory 'duel' of
gdb. Duel is then compiled into the library duel.a. Then, you
modify the gdb Makefile to include the module duel/duelgdb.c and
to link with duel/src/duel.a. You also need to modify one source line
in gdb's code, to change comments to start with '##' instead of '#'.
If everything goes well, after another 'make' the new gdb executable
should support the 'duel' command (alias 'dl').  You can test it by
running gdb and giving a command like "dl 1..10". There is also
a test suite.

DETAILS
1. Get the gdb distribution, install, configure, compile and test it.
   The configure script works pretty well, but watch out for weird
   utilities in your path (e.g. GNU sed was in my PATH before the
   standard sed. It was incompatible and caused lots of trouble).
   Most common use is ./configure sparc or ./configure decstation
   and then just "make".

   SUN SPARC, SunOS4.1.x/Solaris 1.x: use gcc on SUN, since duel uses
   prototypes and SUN's pre-ANSI cc can't handle them. Change gdb/Makefile:
   from GCC=gcc to CC=gcc, but note the warnings about the ioctrl in the
   makefile (I had no problems with gcc 2.1; I am not sure what these
   warnings imply).

   SPARC, Solaris 2.x: no problems expected. Compiled ok with Sun
                       unbundled SPARCompiler C 2.0.1.

   SGI iris machines: use ./configure iris4. Note that gdb is broken on
   the irises (can't write to the target), so it cripples the use of duel
   as well (no declared variables (use aliases), no strings).

   DEC mips machines: This is what duel was developed on, should work fine.
   use straight cc, shouldn't have any problems.

   IBM RS/6000: no problems expected in Duel 1.10.

   SONY MIPS: seems like compiling with gcc makes gdb behaves in a random
   ways when functions in the target are called. Try using plain 'cc' without
   the -O flag if the gdb test-suite fails on calls to e.g. printf())

   HP9000: gcc (2.2.2?) can't compile gdb right now, hopefully soon; For now,
           you should use "CC=cc -Aa", and fix gdb's ANSI C problems:
           in gdb/value.h & gdb/expression.h, change "#ifdef __STDC__"
           to "#if defined(__STDC__) && !defined(__hppa)".

   System V: there is no 'ranlib' and it is not needed to build duel.a
             modifiy the src/Makefile for RANLIB=echo.
             printf() does not recognize "%p" for pointers. run the following:
             mv print.c print.old; sed 's/%p/%08x/' print.old >print.c

   OS/2: duel works fine with gdb/gcc "emx 0.8f" under OS/2 !

   Other machines: you should test gdb's ability to allocate and write into
   the target's memory. Compile tsuite.c and start it under gdb (single step
   twice). Now, enter the command
        gdb> print "test"
   If it fails, gdb can not find "malloc", can't call it, or can't write
   to the target's memory; duel will be limited in functionality.


2. Unpack the duel source code into a subdirectory 'duel' of gdb.
   DO NOT unpack it in the gdb directory, since duel source files
   like eval.c will clash with gdb source files. The gdb directory
   is the one that contains files like 'values.c', 'valops.c'.
   e.g.  cd gdb-4.8/gdb ; mkdir duel ; cd duel ; zcat ~/duel.tar.Z |tar xvf -

3. In gdb/duel/src, run make. This compiles the Duel source code into
   duel.a, to be later linked with gdb. The makefile is pretty
   simple. You can used either cc or gcc, but it must support ANSI
   prototypes. All system include files are in duel.h.
   On SUN machines, you must use gcc (cc doesn't support prototypes)
   you will need to modify y.tab.c, because it declares malloc
   incorrectly (first line in the file, delete it)

   The program duelself will also be created (A stand-alone duel code
   for testing)

4. Verify that duel is compiled ok by running duelself and giving
   a command like (1..4)*(4,2.5). You can also run the whole
   test suite with "duelself <tsuite.self >self.out" and compare
   the tsuite.self.out and self.out files. Note that memory
   references are likely to be different. Also, beware that the
   test suite has intentional errors (not all marked clearly).

5. Add a link from gdb/duel/duelgdb.c to gdb/duelgdb.c, or just
   move the duel/duelgdb.c file to gdb's main dir.

6. Edit gdb's Makefile. The Makefile is produced automatically,
   so any changes you made will be undone if you reconfigure gdb.
   You may change either the Makefile, or the Makefile.in (in
   which case gdb should re-configure itself automatically,
   and might require a total recompile). If you only going to
   compile duel once, and you already compiled gdb, I suggest
   you just modify the Makefile.

   A. Locate the SFILES_MAINDIR = macro. add duelgdb.c
   B. Locate OBS = macro. add duelgdb.o
   C. Locate CLIBS = macro. add duel/src/duel.a
   D. You can also add duel/src/duel.a to CDEPS = if you want to
      rebuild gdb automatically each time duel.a changes.

   Normally, duel.out contains all the "dl" commands you used (only the
   user input). I would appreciate it if you mail me such output so I can
   see how you use Duel. You can avoid this file by compiling with
   -DNO_DUEL_OUT (added to CFLAGS in the makefile).

7. Modify gdb's comments to start with '##' instead of '#', since
   duel uses '#' as an operator. This step is optional -- you could
   use %/ and %% for #/ and # (see duel/parse.y).
   in file main.c line 1529 or near by, "else if (c == '#')"
   modify to "else if (c == '#' && *p1 == '#')"

8. In gdb's directory, remove init.c (make creates it automatically)
   and run make. The new gdb binary should support the duel (alias dl)
   commands. You can test it by running gdb
   and trying 'dl 1..10' which should print the numbers from 1 to 10.
   A test suite tsuite.gdb is in duel/src. to use, first compile
   tsuite.c, cc -g tsuite.c -o tsuite, then run gdb <tsuite.gdb >gdb.out
   (can take several minutes) and compare the output to tsuite.gdb.out.
   Again, beware that there are intentional errors in the test suite, and
   that output of addresses/pointer is likely to differ e.g. these are OK:
   45c45
   < x+5 = @10014014
   ---
   > x+5 = @3e9f4

   Possible problems: (1) duel uses assert.h. If you use gcc, you could
   end up with an undefined __eprintf from gdb's assert.h. Either use
   cc, point to the standard assert.h, or use gcc -U__GNUC__.
   (2) if the compiled gdb seems not to have a "dl" command at all, the
   problem is likely  a faulty 'munch' program, part of gdb's makefile
   process to create init.c. Make sure init.c calls _initialized_duel();
   if not, delete init.c and run make again. Check that munch, a shell
   script, uses a non-buggy 'sed' program.

9. Install the new gdb as "duel" instead of "gdb". Also install the
   manual page duel/duel.1. Finally, let me know that are using it!
   Send email to mg@cs.princeton.edu. All comments are welcome!

WHY SO MANY STEPS?
Because I don't want to distribute a modified version of any GNU stuff.
this protects you from being GNU-ized if you only want the duel code.
