DUEL 1.0x INTERNALS
This documents some of the basics internal info, and might help porting
duel. Incomplete and probably badly written. sorry.

Entry points and modules
--------------------------
duel_eval_and_parse is entry point into duel, in duel.c
duel_parse in parse.y does all parsing
duel_eval  in eval.c makes the evaluation
evalop.c contains low-level evaluation
misc.c   contains misc stuff
types.c  type create/manage
output.c all output goes thru duel_printf
output2.c same as output, but support sending eval output to a pipe,
          like the duel.pipe perl script.
print.c  all output of values is done here
eval.c   high level evaluation code (generators)
evalops.c low level evaluation code (operators)
error.c   handle erros, display error info "nicely"

start reading the code from duel.c, then global.h, then eval.c.
eval.c is hairy, especially the state-keeping code. The goto's are
intentional, they convey control better than other constructs.

Types
------
A relatively straight-forward system, if you have read code of real C
compilers. A type is a "graph" with each node being a base type or
a composition of other types. see global.h and types.c

Value system
-------------
also pretty simple, either an LVALUE, which have u.lvalue point to it,
or an RVALUE, so u.rval_type contains the actual value. There is also
a special BVALUE hack to hold lvalued bitfields, which is only useful
is someone implements modifying a bitfield. and there is an FVALUE, which
is just stored in u.rval_int but has the special value type (it was either
this or add a new TYPE, i preferred a new value).
Note the there is no "register" type support. You must read register variables
as rvalues (duelgdb.c does that). I don't think it is essential, since
gdb can be used directly to modify such values (this might be a
problem in watchpoint/cond.breaks however). Also cc -g don't usually keep
stuff in registers. We could add "SVALUE" for these.
Bitfields are a pain, but bvalue is really needed, eg for x[..100].bitfield=0

Memory allocation
-----------------
go through duel_malloc/duel_free.
Memory is allocated only for (a) a new node, while parsing, (b) a value pushed
on stack for x-->y operator (c) duel aliases.
It is always safe to call duel_free_nodes  which free everything except
for aliases.
Memory spill can occur in asynchronous interrupts (^C), but they at most
reflect items moved from one list to another. This isn't too bad.

Interrupts
----------
Duel ignores the issues of interrupts, but is written so it can be
interrupted at any time. Naturally, some memory could be lost if an
operation is interrupted, since Duel does not setup critical sections.
However, interrupts will no result in bad internal structures, so it is
safe to call duel_free_nodes after an interrupt.
duelgdb.c implements exactly that - interrupts at all times, and cleanup
using duel_free_nodes.

Parsing
--------
yacc is pretty weak, especially when I tried complex ops like x\y#z
(as a single, 3 val op!). I have up on such things and the syntax is
pretty clean. Things to watch for are the semicolon nonsense,
especially with optional-expressions (as in for(a;b;c);), the T hack
for user types (only fix is to delay decision on (x)(y) till runtime
or make clearer rules (consider   something; (x)(y), do you parse x as a type
and ignore the possible x:=printf in "something", etc), and the use of ","
regular op and nodes for function parameters (the parser knows only about
a single parameter, an exp!).

Search ops
-----------
Straight forward stacking in dfs_... in eval.c
Note things are put in reversed, so root-->(left,right) does what you
expect. Also linked-lists could be greatly optimized.
The functionality for ->> (BFS) is already in, all you need is to
make the stack into a queue by pushing from the other side (really append)

Multi-expressions
--------------------
As far as I know, you could save root (in duel.h) and use it to evaluate
as often as needed (e.g for breakpoints/watchpoints), the internals
of the nodes hold all eval info. You must reset the expression
with eval_stop, if u dont eval it to the last value. Also make sure you
cleanup the dot stack. Aliases (in misc.c) could become scoped, of course.

Interface to the debugger
-------------------------

What DUEL needs:
1. A way to access the symbol table for variable names, types, etc.
2. A way to access the value of a variable, both for read and writes.
3. A way to call debuggee functions.
4. A way to get locals of frame n
5. misc functions, eg memory alloc, entery/exit code

In practice, you will probably take duelgdb.c and modify it until you
get the "right thing" for your debugger.
NOTE: duelgdb.c was written from scratch and has *no* GNU code in it.

The most complex issue is types - you must pass names in a tvalue,
which include a tctype (the C reminds one of a "C" type, not just 'type'
which is ambiguous). The code to convert gdb types into duel types is
typical. Watch out for recursive struct pointers (the hash table handles
these problems), and for partial types, e.g. pointer to struct which
contains no fields (size zero!).

You can return a BVALUE an LVALUE (preferred) or an RVALUE for a name
lookup. use RVALUE for names found in registers, and return the actual
value.

if a frame number is given for symbol lookup, only local variables
allocated in that frame should be returned. (else return none. don't
return a global if it exist with the same name, this will make the dot
stack compute things wrong).

Node that this doesnt help with scoping problems (for duel)- e.g.
you can't do myfunc.x if x is a static variable in myfunc. There needs to
be a more complex & general way in the language to specify this (i.e.
specify a source location in which the variable is visible, AND a frame
to use if the value is kept on a frame)  frame(n).(scope(file,line).x)?
