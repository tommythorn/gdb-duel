 print types, do so better

DUEL.PIPE - make it general purpose
------------------------------------
see duel.pipe for some details.
should be made general purpose, so it is easy to modify/add functions.
many basic functions can be writted - sort, uniq, matrix, vector,
compress, etc.

Checking for cycles in --> expansion
------------------------------------
One can easily add code to handle head-->(next!=?head), as well as
head-->(next!=?_). If you don't know what these do, you should RTFM again :-)

You can also keep all pointers that have been expanded already,
hence detecting any kind of cycle. However, what to do in
such cases is debatable. Some users would like to see
cycles terminate expansion quietly, while others will want a fatal error
to be produced. This could be handled by an operator like x-->?y which
would indicate that cycles are ok and expansion should terminate quietly,
while x-->y produce an error on cycles.

Another idea is to have _cyc defined inside -->, to allow the user to
do something about cycles, e.g.  head-->(if(!_cyc) next). There are
several ways to manage _cyc: a boolean, or equal to head; true if
this is already a cycle, or a function cyc(next), which return true if
next would cycle, or return next unles it would cycle, etc.
This last one seems to handle most cases:
head-->(cyc(left),cyc(right))	- return tree, igoring cycles
head-->(cyc(0),left,right) 	- like head->(left,right), but mention of cyc
				  which by itself does nothing, cause general
				  cycle detection as errors
as above, but left!=?_		- detect general cycles, pointer to self ok

While we adding cyc(), we can also add _depth to indicate current depth,
e.g. head-->(if(_depth<6) (left,right)) -- expand only to depth 6
and also acceess to the current path with _path(i), _path(0)=_ and 
_path(_depth-1)=head
head-->(cyc(0), if(! ||/_path(.._deapth)==left) left, ...)
		which avoids cycles "in the path"

If you an strong opinion on this subject, or a better idea, lemme know!

Other expansions: x->>y x->-y x>--y
------------------------------------
x-->y applies DFS (Depth First Search). Another useful expansion would be
BFS (Breath First Search). It is simple to implement - y's values should
be put on a queue instead of a stack, and the code in place has been written
with this in mind (eval.c).
Others will probably want a post-order or in-order search instead of preorder
search as done by x-->y. I am not sure this is important enough to merit
new operators, but ->- for inorder and >-- for post order are reserved.
These, too, should be easy to implement, but it is very unclear that the
added complexity to the language is worth it. If you really need such
operators, lemme know.

Increment count for x..y   (x..y:+z and x..y:-z)
------------------------------------------------
The x..y operator could be extended to support an increment or decrement
value. This would allow 1..n to be written as 1..n:+1 so when n==0 it
will not produce the surprising 1,0 results. 
However, 0..10:+2 could also be written as (0..5)*2, so it is unclear
that such operators are really needed (maybe just x..+y, x..-y to force
the direction).


Duel functions / print procedures
-------------------------------------
the command:  dl define x expr
will define x to be duel procedure for expression expr.
x can then be used like an alias (indeed, it will probably be kept in
the alias table with a special value). x evaluation returns multiple 
values. 
There is no need parameters, since emp.x would call "x" using the implicit
parameter "_" set as emp. the expression for x is essentially put into
the code for the execution. Having no parameters (except implicit ones)
make it easier to document, use etc.

Such functions (macros?) are most useful for output. e.g.
dl define empout  val_type,a, u.if(val_type==0) code*6,name else code,z
dl emp.empout
will produce output for 
  struct {
   int val_type,code ;
   char a;
   union { char *name ; double z ; } u 
   } emp ;

the empout procedure can be defined just once, and used to output such
unions as needed.

The next step is to call such functions automatically for output and
for expansion. We add syntax like  dl define out(type) expr

then whenever an expression of the given type is to be printed, this
code is evaluated instead, e.g.:
dl define out(struct emp) ...
dl emp   	## this calls the above out code for the output.

We can also expand expressions by calling the right function, e.g.
The operator "\" calls a function to expand a specific type:
dl define \(struct list *)  (_-->next)
dl if(\head#i == \head#j && i<j) \head[[i,j]]

instead of writing this code (find non unique elements of linked list):
   if(head-->next#i == head-->next#j && i<j) head-->next[[i,j]]

Both printing and expansion occurs automatically based on TYPE.
It is unclear if the an array is allowed to be expanded by a pointer
type expansion or not (i.e. is \(int *) to expand "int x[40]").
this might require an extension to types allowing \(int [n]) which matches
any int array and set n for the specific bound. Types could be extended
in a similar way, e.g. \(type **) _[0..]@0
which expands any array of pointers (e.g. argv).
This can quickly require scope-nesting for local aliases/variables.

As before, it is unclear what of these is useful. Unless people depends on
duel heavily, and write such "output/expansion" functions for the project,
the features are useless (who is going to use this interactively?)

Regular expressions for names. $xxx and `xxx`
----------------------------------------------
this allows things like emp.`value_*` to return all the value_something
fields. it is really useful with structs, especially if a grep-style hat (^)
is supported. Obviously extends to func.rexp, to show all locals, etc,
which will make it possible to write a  stack-trace display in duel.

exact semantics (e.g. what is matched and how) unclear.


Nicer #/
---------

hash[..1024] => #/_-->next >? 2

it is probably best if #/(exp) constructed (exp) as symbolic before it
gets the values. or maybe, yes, best is #/(e) symbolic is #/(e1..en)
where e1 is the first return symbolc, en the last.
