WHATNEW for DUEL 1.10 distribution   mg@cs.princeton.edu (M. Golan) Mar 93
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
patch 1.10.4 fix use of system("date") to support OS/2
patch 1.10.3 bug fix left->left bad symbolic, long symbolics caused crash
patch 1.10.2 bug fix (type*) casting was wrong
patch 1.10.1 bug fix frame(0).bad_name crashed duel. enum size zero,
             sometimes possible in symbol tables, now allowed.

What's New in version 1.10
--------------------------
Previously, all typedefs had to be preceded with 'T', e.g. (T uint) x.
The parsing is now hacked, so that the most common cases don't require T:
(type)x and (type*)x, e.g., (uint)x, *(value *)p. T is still required in
complex casts like (T value (*)())p, in variable declaration "T uint x ;"
and with sizeof(T uint). Side effects of this change:  (printf)("hi\n")
won't work, since (printf) is recognized as a cast. This shouldn't be a
problem - you can use {x} for (x). Also, "sizeof x" is no longer supported,
you must use sizeof(x) instead.

An experimental output control through a pipe has been added. To try it,
you should change duel/src/Makefile to compile output2.o instead of output.o
(delete duel.a to make sure it won't have both output.o and output2.o).
When output2.o is linked into duelself and/or gdb, duel fork and execute
the command duel.pipe in the current directory. All the output from expression
evaluation is sent to this program and its output is displayed. An example
duel.pipe, a Perl script, is provided. A lot that can be done with duel.pipe
to process the results symbolically, e.g., display integers in decimal,
place values on the same line, fork and execute xgraph, check
for unique values, etc. I would appreciate any comments on its use.

A few minor bugs have been fixed. duel.man now contains a nicely formatted
version of duel.1. Portability was improved. #/(x) provide a better symbolic
expression.

What's new in version 1.02
--------------------------
a few bug fixed, improved portability, gdb4.8 support.
